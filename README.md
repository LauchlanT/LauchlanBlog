# LauchlanBlog

Repository for my personal portfolio site and blog, [LauchlanToal.com](https://lauchlantoal.com)

The backend code is programmed in Go, with AWS Lambda endpoints managed by AWS APIGateway through Lambda Proxy Integration.

Changes to Go files in this repository are pushed to AWS via Github Actions.

For more detail about the design of the website, see [this brief write-up](https://lauchlantoal.com/blog/lauchlantoal).

Credit to Jakob Lind's [post on deploying NodeJS from Github to AWS Lambda](https://blog.jakoblind.no/aws-lambda-github-actions/) for helping to understand the process of using Github Actions for this.
