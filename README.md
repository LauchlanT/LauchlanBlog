# LauchlanBlog

Repository for my personal portfolio site and blog, [LauchlanToal.com](https://lauchlantoal.com)

The backend code is programmed in Go, with AWS Lambda endpoints managed by AWS APIGateway through Lambda Proxy Integration.

Changes to Go files in this repository are pushed to AWS via Github Actions.
